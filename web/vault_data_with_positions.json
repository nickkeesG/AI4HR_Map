The tool automatically clustered thousands of tweets to reveal different viewpoints on AI governance, safety approaches, and development concerns, finding significant overlap between groups despite their different priorities.",

The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The mechanism works through a three-party structure: experts submit both beliefs and explanations to a supervisor, who then reports aggregated beliefs to a principal, with all parties scored using proper scoring rules based on accuracy. The key insight is that a supervisor can credibly commit to ignoring any expert reports that lack explanations, which forces experts to provide rationales despite the extra effort required, because without explanations, experts receive zero reward.",

The authors argue for establishing societal standards and institutions to evaluate and certify AI truthfulness, moving beyond current approaches that rely on human-like accountability mechanisms which don't translate well to AI systems. They outline technical approaches for building more truthful AI systems and explore the governance frameworks needed to implement truthfulness standards at scale, including certification bodies and adjudication processes for evaluating AI statements.",

The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

They tested the \"digi-Dan\" model by asking both the real Dennett and the AI model ten philosophical questions, then had 425 participants try to distinguish between Dennett's actual answers and the machine-generated responses. The study found that experts often chose the AI's answers over Dennett's actual responses, and on two questions, the AI outputs were selected by more experts than Dennett's own answers.",

Researchers ran a randomized experiment where groups made recidivism risk predictions with AI help, and some groups also had an LLM devil's advocate that either questioned the AI's recommendations or challenged the group's majority opinion. The devil's advocate used critique questions and comments to prompt deeper thinking. The key finding was that questioning AI recommendations significantly improved group accuracy, while questioning group opinions provided no benefit.",

The system addresses the buyer's inspection paradox in information markets, where buyers need access to information to assess its value, but sellers need to limit access to prevent theft. The key innovation is that AI agents have dual capabilities: they can evaluate the quality of privileged information and can \"forget\" unpurchased content, allowing temporary inspection without unauthorized retention.",

The mechanism works through a three-party structure: experts submit both beliefs and explanations to a supervisor, who then reports aggregated beliefs to a principal, with all parties scored using proper scoring rules based on accuracy. The key insight is that a supervisor can credibly commit to ignoring any expert reports that lack explanations, which forces experts to provide rationales despite the extra effort required, because without explanations, experts receive zero reward.",

The paper argues that as AI becomes more powerful, it will dramatically reshape how society generates knowledge and makes decisions, creating both opportunities to enhance human reasoning and risks of manipulation or poor coordination.",

The research reveals that while AI has enormous theoretical potential for helping journalists analyze large datasets and uncover hidden patterns of public interest, current applications remain limited to relatively simple tasks like document classification and data cleaning.",

The researchers adapted existing reinforcement learning algorithms (like GRPO and ReMax) to work with the messy, delayed feedback that comes from real-world prediction tasks, using a dataset of over 100,000 forecasting questions from sources like Polymarket. Their approach produces a 14B parameter model that matches the accuracy of frontier models like OpenAI's o1 while achieving better calibration, ultimately translating this into higher hypothetical trading profits when betting against prediction markets.",

The authors argue for establishing societal standards and institutions to evaluate and certify AI truthfulness, moving beyond current approaches that rely on human-like accountability mechanisms which don't translate well to AI systems. They outline technical approaches for building more truthful AI systems and explore the governance frameworks needed to implement truthfulness standards at scale, including certification bodies and adjudication processes for evaluating AI statements.",

A specialized chatbot engages participants in dialogue about contentious scenarios, asking for personal stories and role models to extract the underlying value behind responses rather than collecting ideological commitments like slogans or rules. The system then shows participants stories of people transitioning between different values and asks whether such transitions represent gains in wisdom, creating a graph structure where edges represent consensus about which values are more comprehensive than others\n\nFunded by [OpenAI Democratic Inputs to AI](https://github.com/openai/democratic-inputs).",
