The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The key insight is that a supervisor can credibly commit to ignoring any expert reports that lack explanations, which forces experts to provide rationales despite the extra effort required, because without explanations, experts receive zero reward.",

The researchers adapted existing reinforcement learning algorithms (like GRPO and ReMax) to work with the messy, delayed feedback that comes from real-world prediction tasks, using a dataset of over 100,000 forecasting questions from sources like Polymarket. Their approach produces a 14B parameter model that matches the accuracy of frontier models like OpenAI's o1 while achieving better calibration, ultimately translating this into higher hypothetical trading profits when betting against prediction markets.",

The researchers tested 38 different prompts across four major LLMs using 100 forecasting questions, followed by a second study with compound and professionally-designed prompts. Surprisingly, they found that most prompt modifications had negligible or even negative effects on forecasting accuracy, with some techniques like explicit Bayesian reasoning actually making predictions worse.",

The system identifies specific negotiation mistakes using an annotation scheme developed with [MBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Business_Administration) instructors, then provides detailed feedback on preparation strategies (like setting appropriate target prices) and in-conversation tactics (like including rationales with offers and strategic closing behavior). Through a controlled experiment with 374 participants across two negotiation rounds, the researchers demonstrated that users who received ACE's coaching significantly improved their objective negotiation outcomes compared to control groups.",

The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

Researchers ran a randomized experiment where groups made recidivism risk predictions with AI help, and some groups also had an LLM devil's advocate that either questioned the AI's recommendations or challenged the group's majority opinion. The devil's advocate used critique questions and comments to prompt deeper thinking. The key finding was that questioning AI recommendations significantly improved group accuracy, while questioning group opinions provided no benefit.",

The system combines AI-augmented group discussions with bridging-based ranking algorithms to identify points of consensus, then uses GPT-4 to translate these into concrete policy guidelines that are refined through expert input and further public feedback.\n\nFunded by [OpenAI Democratic Inputs to AI](https://github.com/openai/democratic-inputs).",

The system addresses the buyer's inspection paradox in information markets, where buyers need access to information to assess its value, but sellers need to limit access to prevent theft. The key innovation is that AI agents have dual capabilities: they can evaluate the quality of privileged information and can \"forget\" unpurchased content, allowing temporary inspection without unauthorized retention.",

The mechanism works through a three-party structure: experts submit both beliefs and explanations to a supervisor, who then reports aggregated beliefs to a principal, with all parties scored using proper scoring rules based on accuracy. The key insight is that a supervisor can credibly commit to ignoring any expert reports that lack explanations, which forces experts to provide rationales despite the extra effort required, because without explanations, experts receive zero reward.",

The framework argues that effective AI-augmented deliberation requires balancing two key elements: \n1. participants' ability to understand and steer AI outputs (human agency) and \n2. their commitment to deliberative outcomes \n\nHigher-commitment decisions requiring correspondingly higher human agency.",

The mechanism works through a three-party structure: experts submit both beliefs and explanations to a supervisor, who then reports aggregated beliefs to a principal, with all parties scored using proper scoring rules based on accuracy. The key insight is that a supervisor can credibly commit to ignoring any expert reports that lack explanations, which forces experts to provide rationales despite the extra effort required, because without explanations, experts receive zero reward.",

The authors argue for establishing societal standards and institutions to evaluate and certify AI truthfulness, moving beyond current approaches that rely on human-like accountability mechanisms which don't translate well to AI systems. They outline technical approaches for building more truthful AI systems and explore the governance frameworks needed to implement truthfulness standards at scale, including certification bodies and adjudication processes for evaluating AI statements.",

The study involved 214 national security experts and compared their responses to AI-simulated teams in a fictional U.S.-China crisis scenario over the Taiwan Strait. The research found that while LLMs showed significant overlap with human decision-making patterns, they demonstrated concerning tendencies toward more aggressive actions and were significantly affected by changes in scenario parameters.",

The researchers tested five different LLMs controlling autonomous nation agents and discovered that all models showed escalatory patterns, with some developing arms-race dynamics and making decisions based on concerning justifications like deterrence and first-strike tactics.",

The researchers tested 38 different prompts across four major LLMs using 100 forecasting questions, followed by a second study with compound and professionally-designed prompts. Surprisingly, they found that most prompt modifications had negligible or even negative effects on forecasting accuracy, with some techniques like explicit Bayesian reasoning actually making predictions worse.",
