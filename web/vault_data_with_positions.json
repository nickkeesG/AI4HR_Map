The tool automatically clustered thousands of tweets to reveal different viewpoints on AI governance, safety approaches, and development concerns, finding significant overlap between groups despite their different priorities.",

The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The researchers adapted existing reinforcement learning algorithms (like GRPO and ReMax) to work with the messy, delayed feedback that comes from real-world prediction tasks, using a dataset of over 100,000 forecasting questions from sources like Polymarket. Their approach produces a 14B parameter model that matches the accuracy of frontier models like OpenAI's o1 while achieving better calibration, ultimately translating this into higher hypothetical trading profits when betting against prediction markets.",

The study shows that while individual LLMs typically underperform human crowds, aggregating predictions from multiple LLMs creates a \"wisdom of the silicon crowd\" effect that matches human accuracy on 31 binary forecasting questions.",

The authors conclude that AI-assisted scenario development shows significant promise as a tool for generating \"raw material\" that human facilitators can refine.",

The researchers tested 38 different prompts across four major LLMs using 100 forecasting questions, followed by a second study with compound and professionally-designed prompts. Surprisingly, they found that most prompt modifications had negligible or even negative effects on forecasting accuracy, with some techniques like explicit Bayesian reasoning actually making predictions worse.",

The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The study involved 214 national security experts and compared their responses to AI-simulated teams in a fictional U.S.-China crisis scenario over the Taiwan Strait.

The researchers developed a method where participants provide written opinions on political questions, and an AI system generates candidate consensus statements that aim to find common ground among the group members.\n\n(research from 2022)",
