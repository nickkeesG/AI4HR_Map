The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The researchers adapted existing reinforcement learning algorithms (like GRPO and ReMax) to work with the messy, delayed feedback that comes from real-world prediction tasks, using a dataset of over 100,000 forecasting questions from sources like Polymarket. Their approach produces a 14B parameter model that matches the accuracy of frontier models like OpenAI's o1 while achieving better calibration, ultimately translating this into higher hypothetical trading profits when betting against prediction markets.",

The study shows that while individual LLMs typically underperform human crowds, aggregating predictions from multiple LLMs creates a \"wisdom of the silicon crowd\" effect that matches human accuracy on 31 binary forecasting questions.",

The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The researchers developed a process that uses AI-powered interviews to elicit specific \"values cards\" from people (detailed descriptions of what they pay attention to when making meaningful choices) then connects these values in a graph structure based on which values participants consider \"wiser\" than others.",

A specialized chatbot engages participants in dialogue about contentious scenarios, asking for personal stories and role models to extract the underlying value behind responses rather than collecting ideological commitments like slogans or rules. The system then shows participants stories of people transitioning between different values and asks whether such transitions represent gains in wisdom, creating a graph structure where edges represent consensus about which values are more comprehensive than others\n\nFunded by [OpenAI Democratic Inputs to AI](https://github.com/openai/democratic-inputs).",

The study involved 214 national security experts and compared their responses to AI-simulated teams in a fictional U.S.-China crisis scenario over the Taiwan Strait. The research found that while LLMs showed significant overlap with human decision-making patterns, they demonstrated concerning tendencies toward more aggressive actions and were significantly affected by changes in scenario parameters.",

The approach involves optimizing AIs to persuade humans of both truths and falsehoods, analyzing what manipulation strategies they develop, and then training detection systems to identify these techniques in real-world scenarios.",
