The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The mechanism works through a three-party structure: experts submit both beliefs and explanations to a supervisor, who then reports aggregated beliefs to a principal, with all parties scored using proper scoring rules based on accuracy. The key insight is that a supervisor can credibly commit to ignoring any expert reports that lack explanations, which forces experts to provide rationales despite the extra effort required, because without explanations, experts receive zero reward.",

The researchers tested 38 different prompts across four major LLMs using 100 forecasting questions, followed by a second study with compound and professionally-designed prompts. Surprisingly, they found that most prompt modifications had negligible or even negative effects on forecasting accuracy, with some techniques like explicit Bayesian reasoning actually making predictions worse.",

The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

Researchers ran a randomized experiment where groups made recidivism risk predictions with AI help, and some groups also had an LLM devil's advocate that either questioned the AI's recommendations or challenged the group's majority opinion. The devil's advocate used critique questions and comments to prompt deeper thinking. The key finding was that questioning AI recommendations significantly improved group accuracy, while questioning group opinions provided no benefit.",

The mechanism works through a three-party structure: experts submit both beliefs and explanations to a supervisor, who then reports aggregated beliefs to a principal, with all parties scored using proper scoring rules based on accuracy. The key insight is that a supervisor can credibly commit to ignoring any expert reports that lack explanations, which forces experts to provide rationales despite the extra effort required, because without explanations, experts receive zero reward.",

The mechanism works through a three-party structure: experts submit both beliefs and explanations to a supervisor, who then reports aggregated beliefs to a principal, with all parties scored using proper scoring rules based on accuracy. The key insight is that a supervisor can credibly commit to ignoring any expert reports that lack explanations, which forces experts to provide rationales despite the extra effort required, because without explanations, experts receive zero reward.",

The authors argue for establishing societal standards and institutions to evaluate and certify AI truthfulness, moving beyond current approaches that rely on human-like accountability mechanisms which don't translate well to AI systems. They outline technical approaches for building more truthful AI systems and explore the governance frameworks needed to implement truthfulness standards at scale, including certification bodies and adjudication processes for evaluating AI statements.",

The authors conclude that AI-assisted scenario development shows significant promise as a tool for generating \"raw material\" that human facilitators can refine.",

The researchers tested 38 different prompts across four major LLMs using 100 forecasting questions, followed by a second study with compound and professionally-designed prompts. Surprisingly, they found that most prompt modifications had negligible or even negative effects on forecasting accuracy, with some techniques like explicit Bayesian reasoning actually making predictions worse.",

The framework argues that effective AI-augmented deliberation requires balancing two key elements: \n1. participants' ability to understand and steer AI outputs (human agency) and \n2. their commitment to deliberative outcomes \n\nHigher-commitment decisions requiring correspondingly higher human agency.",
