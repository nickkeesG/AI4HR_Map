The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The mechanism works through a three-party structure: experts submit both beliefs and explanations to a supervisor, who then reports aggregated beliefs to a principal, with all parties scored using proper scoring rules based on accuracy. The key insight is that a supervisor can credibly commit to ignoring any expert reports that lack explanations, which forces experts to provide rationales despite the extra effort required, because without explanations, experts receive zero reward.",

The researchers adapted existing reinforcement learning algorithms (like GRPO and ReMax) to work with the messy, delayed feedback that comes from real-world prediction tasks, using a dataset of over 100,000 forecasting questions from sources like Polymarket. Their approach produces a 14B parameter model that matches the accuracy of frontier models like OpenAI's o1 while achieving better calibration, ultimately translating this into higher hypothetical trading profits when betting against prediction markets.",

The authors conclude that AI-assisted scenario development shows significant promise as a tool for generating \"raw material\" that human facilitators can refine.",

The study shows that while individual LLMs typically underperform human crowds, aggregating predictions from multiple LLMs creates a \"wisdom of the silicon crowd\" effect that matches human accuracy on 31 binary forecasting questions.",

The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The author breaks down LEPs into 13 distinct components including data collection, world modeling, human elicitation, numeric modeling, decomposition/amplification techniques, and various forms of automated decision support. A central argument is that these systems will require substantial \"scaffolding\" (supporting software infrastructure) and will likely be dominated by centralized platforms rather than distributed individual forecasters, potentially replacing human participation in prediction markets like Manifold and Metaculus. The post also addresses potential risks including AI acceleration, misuse by malicious actors, and the challenge that these powerful epistemic tools might increase world complexity faster than they improve our ability to navigate it.",

The researchers develop prompting techniques that guide models like GPT-4 to reason through ethical scenarios using theories from normative ethics (Justice, Deontology, Utilitarianism) and moral psychology (Theory of Dyadic Morality), producing explainable moral reasoning and decisions.",

The research reveals that while AI has enormous theoretical potential for helping journalists analyze large datasets and uncover hidden patterns of public interest, current applications remain limited to relatively simple tasks like document classification and data cleaning.",

The researchers tested 38 different prompts across four major LLMs using 100 forecasting questions, followed by a second study with compound and professionally-designed prompts.

A specialized chatbot engages participants in dialogue about contentious scenarios, asking for personal stories and role models to extract the underlying value behind responses rather than collecting ideological commitments like slogans or rules. The system then shows participants stories of people transitioning between different values and asks whether such transitions represent gains in wisdom, creating a graph structure where edges represent consensus about which values are more comprehensive than others\n\nFunded by [OpenAI Democratic Inputs to AI](https://github.com/openai/democratic-inputs).",
